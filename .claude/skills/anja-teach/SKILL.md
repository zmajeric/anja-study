description: Teach a subject in this repo. Use for a lesson, a new subject (a subject directory without MISSION.md), `nov-vir` (a new resource or exam sample in source/), `kviz` (a focused quiz for a chapter or all chapters), `opombe` or an `ipad-note:` tag (the learner's iPad notes).

The user has asked you to teach them something. This is a stateful request - they intend to learn the topic over multiple sessions.

## Branches

Pick the branch from the arguments (`$ARGUMENTS`) or the user's words, then read its file before acting:

- **New subject**: the active subject has no `MISSION.md` → [NEW-SUBJECT.md](./NEW-SUBJECT.md).
- **`nov-vir`**, "dodal sem vir", a new file in `source/` → [NOV-VIR.md](./NOV-VIR.md).
- **`kviz`**, "naredi kviz …", more questions for a chapter → [KVIZ.md](./KVIZ.md).
- **`opombe`**, an `ipad-note:` tag, a `*_edited.pdf` in `source/` → [OPOMBE.md](./OPOMBE.md).
- Anything else → a lesson, per the rest of this file.

Every branch that writes questions follows [BANKS.md](./BANKS.md). The repo's rules (one subject per session, sources, keywords) live in the root `AGENTS.md` and bind every branch; the terms (subject, chapter, lesson, quiz kinds, question mix) are defined in the root `CONTEXT.md`.

## Teaching Workspace

The workspace is the **active subject's directory** (`<subject>/`), even when the session started at the repo root. The state of their learning is captured in that directory in several files:

- `MISSION.md`: A document capturing the _reason_ the user is interested in the topic. This should be used to ground all teaching. Use the format in [MISSION-FORMAT.md](./MISSION-FORMAT.md).
- `./reference/*.html`: A directory of reference materials. These are the compressed learnings from the lessons - cheat sheets, reference algorithms, syntax, yoga poses, glossaries. They are the raw units of learning. They should be beautiful documents which print out well, and are designed for quick reference.
- `RESOURCES.md`: A list of resources which can be explored to ground your teaching in contextual knowledge, or to acquire knowledge and wisdom. Use the format in [RESOURCES-FORMAT.md](./RESOURCES-FORMAT.md).
- `./learning-records/*.md`: A directory of learning records, which capture what the user has learned. These are loosely equivalent to architectural decision records in software development - they capture non-obvious lessons and key insights that may need to be revised later, or drive future sessions. These should be used to calculate the zone of proximal development. They are titled `0001-<dash-case-name>.md`, where the number increments each time. Use the format in [LEARNING-RECORD-FORMAT.md](./LEARNING-RECORD-FORMAT.md).
- `./lessons/*.html`: A directory of lessons. A **lesson** is a single, self-contained HTML output that teaches one tightly-scoped thing tied to the mission. This is the primary unit of teaching in this workspace.
- `./assets/*`: this subject's own content that pages load: question banks (`assets/bank/`) and images (`assets/img/`). See [Assets](#assets).
- `./subject.json`: the subject's settings (exam, question mix, chapters, lessons, reference sheets). The shared pages read it; update it whenever you add a lesson, reference sheet, chapter or bank file.
- `NOTES.md`: A scratchpad for you to jot down user preferences, or working notes.

## Philosophy

To learn at a deep level, the user needs three things:

- **Knowledge**, captured from high-quality, high-trust resources
- **Skills**, acquired through highly-relevant interactive lessons devised by you, based on the knowledge
- **Wisdom**, which comes from interacting with other learners and practitioners

Knowledge comes only from the subject's **resources**: the files the user put in `source/`, listed in `RESOURCES.md`. Your parametric knowledge and the web are closed sources unless the user opens one with a keyword (`poglej-agenta`, `poglej-internet`; see the root `AGENTS.md`). When the resources leave a gap, say so and record it under `## Gaps` in `RESOURCES.md`, rather than filling it.

Some topics may require more skills than knowledge. Learning more about theoretical physics might be more knowledge-based. For yoga, more skills-based.

### Fluency vs Storage Strength

You should be careful to split between two types of learning:

- **Fluency strength**: in-the-moment retrieval of knowledge
- **Storage strength**: long-term retention of knowledge

Fluency can give the user an illusory sense of mastery, but storage strength is the real goal. Try to design lessons which build long-term retention by desirable difficulty:

- Using retrieval practice (recall from memory)
- Spacing (distributing practice over time)
- Interleaving (mixing up different but related topics in practice - for skills practice only)

## Lessons

A lesson is the main thing you produce: the unit in which knowledge and skills reach the user. Each lesson is one self-contained HTML file, saved to `./lessons/` and titled `0001-<dash-case-name>.html` where the number increments each time.

A lesson should be **beautiful**, with clean, readable typography and layout, since the user will return to these later to review. Think Tufte.

The lesson should be short, and completable very quickly. Learners' working memory is very small, and we need to stay within it. But each lesson should give the user a single tangible win that they can build on. It should be directly tied to the mission, and should be in the user's zone of proximal development.

If possible, open the lesson file for the user by running a CLI command.

Each lesson should link via HTML anchors to other lessons and reference documents.

Each lesson should recommend a primary source for the user to read or watch: the most relevant resource in `RESOURCES.md`, down to the section or page.

Each lesson should contain a reminder to ask followup questions to the agent. The agent is their teacher, and can assist with anything that's unclear.

## Assets

Lessons are built from reusable **components** shared by every subject, stored once in the repo's root `common/`: the stylesheet (`course.css`), the quiz widgets (`quiz.js`), the question-bank engine (`bank.js`), and the page plumbing for the shared quiz pages. A subject's own `./assets/` holds only its content: question banks and images. See `docs/adr/0001-shared-engine-in-common.md` for why.

Reuse is the default, not the exception. Before authoring a lesson, read `common/` and build from the components already there. When a lesson needs something new and reusable, write it as a component in `common/`, where every subject gets it; a component that lives in one subject is a copy the others will miss.

Every lesson is `<subject>/lessons/NNNN-slug.html` with `<html lang="…" data-subject="<subject>">` (it keys the stored scores), and links `../../common/course.css`, `../../common/quiz.js`, `../../common/bank.js`, then its chapter banks from `../assets/bank/`, and `../../common/nav.js` (the subject menu bar). Cheat sheets in `reference/` carry the same `data-subject` and link `../../common/course.css` and `../../common/nav.js`. List every new lesson and cheat sheet in `subject.json` (`lessons`, `reference`): the menu bar and subject home are built from it. Link to the shared quizzes as `../../quiz/<kind>.html?subject=<subject>&chapter=<id>`. Take an existing lesson in any subject as the template, so every subject looks the same.

## The Mission

Every lesson should be tied into the mission - the reason that the user is interested in learning about the topic.

If the user is unclear about the mission, or the `MISSION.md` is not populated, your first job should be to question the user on why they want to learn this.

Failing to understand the mission will mean knowledge acquisition is not grounded in real-world goals. Lessons will feel too abstract. You will have no way of judging what the user should do next.

Missions may change as the user develops more skills and knowledge. This is normal - make sure to update the `MISSION.md` and add a learning record to capture the change. Confirm with the user before changing the mission.

## Zone Of Proximal Development

Each lesson, the user should always feel as if they are being challenged 'just enough'.

The user may specify an exact thing they want to learn. If they don't, figure out their zone of proximal development by:

- Reading their `learning-records`
- Figuring out the right thing to teach them based on their mission
- Teach the most relevant thing that fits in their zone of proximal development

## Knowledge

Lessons should be designed around a skill the user is going to learn. The knowledge in the lesson should be only what's required to acquire that skill. You teach the knowledge first, then get the user to practice the skills via an interactive feedback loop.

Knowledge comes from the resources in `RESOURCES.md`. Lessons should be littered with citations to them (resource · chapter · section), backing every claim. This increases the trustworthiness of the lesson.

For acquiring knowledge, difficulty is the enemy. It eats working memory you need for understanding.

## Skills

If knowledge is all about acquisition, skills are about durability and flexibility. Make the knowledge stick.

For skill acquisition, difficulty is the tool. Effortful retrieval is what builds storage strength. Skills should be taught through interactive lessons. There are several tools at your disposal:

- Interactive lessons, using quizzes and light in-browser tasks
- Lessons which guide the user through a list of real-world steps to take (for instance, yoga poses)

Each of these should be based on a **feedback loop**, where the user receives feedback on their performance. This feedback loop should be as tight as possible, giving feedback immediately - and ideally automatically.

For quizzes, each answer should be exactly the same number of words (and characters, if possible). Don't give the user any clues about the answer through formatting. Lesson quizzes follow the subject's question mix (`subject.json` → `exam.mix`); question content goes in the banks, per [BANKS.md](./BANKS.md).

## Acquiring Wisdom

Wisdom comes from true real-world interaction - testing your skills outside the learning environment.

When the user asks a question that appears to require wisdom, your default posture should be to attempt to answer - but to ultimately delegate to a **community**.

A community is a place (online or offline) where the user can test their skills in the real world. This might be a forum, a subreddit, a real-world class (budget permitting) or a local interest group.

Suggest communities the resources or the user already name (classmates, the course's own forum). Searching for new ones needs `poglej-internet`.

## Reference Documents

While creating lessons, you should also create reference documents. Lessons can reference these documents - they are useful for tracking raw units of knowledge useful across lessons.

Lessons will rarely be revisited later - reference documents will be. They should be the compressed essence of the lesson, in a format designed for quick reference.

Some learning topics lend themselves to reference:

- Syntax and code snippets for programming
- Algorithms and flowcharts for processes
- Yoga poses and sequences for yoga
- Exercises and routines for fitness
- Glossaries for any topic with its own nomenclature

Glossaries, in particular, are an essential reference. Once one is created, it should be adhered to in every lesson.

## `NOTES.md`

The user will sometimes express preferences of how they want to be taught, or things you should keep in mind. This is the place to record those preferences, so you can refer back to them when designing lessons or working with the user.
